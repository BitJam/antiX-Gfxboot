boot loader translations
------------------------

o How do I add a new text?

  - Use the gfxboot/po/bin/gbb-add-text script; example:

      bin/jbb-add-text help "Help ME"

    This will define add a txt_help entry in the files
    bootloader.pot and text.inc.  We keep text.inc sorted
    but don't sort bootloader.pot

o How do I remove a text that's no longer needed?
jbb: I have not verified this recently

  - Use the gfxboot/po/bin/rm_text script; example:

      rm_text help

    This will remove txt_help; the removed lines are stored in the 'old'
    directory.

o How do I add a new language?
jbb: this is not needed since we just copy in the .po files from

transifex.

  - Copy bootloader.pot to <lang>.po. Remember to get <lang>.po translated.
