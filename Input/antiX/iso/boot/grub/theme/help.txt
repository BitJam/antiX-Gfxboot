                     Help for booting %DISTRO% Live via UEFI

The demo user password is "demo".  The root password is "root".  For help, go to
one of these forums and make sure you say you are trying to boot %DISTRO% via
UEFI:  http://forum.mepiscommunity.org/ or http://antix.freeforums.org/. Or
send and email to: liveboot@mxlinux.org

%DISTRO% Customize Boot (text menus)
    Allows you to set the language, the timezone, and a lot of other things with
    text menus early in the boot process. If you select the save option then a
    custom entry  will be created/updated in this bootloader menu with the
    options you selected.

There are several useful boot entries under ">>> Advanced Options for %DISTRO% <<<"

%DISTRO% Failsafe
    If you are having trouble booting or getting to X-Windows (the GUI) then try
    using this entry.

%DISTRO% Create Bootchart
    Creates a /var/log/bootchart.tgz file that can be converted to an image
    using the pybootchartgui program.  The image will show timing and diagnostic
    information for the boot process.

The other entries let you set the console resolution during the EARLY part of
the boot process.  Normally, the resolution will be set to the maximum unless
the "video=WWWWxHHHH" cheat is used.

Hints: Use the "menus" cheat to customize your system using text menus.
       Use "bootsave" to save boot parameters you've entered manually.
