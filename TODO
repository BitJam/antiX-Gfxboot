I did four tests and ran each one twice.  MX vs. MLX and
stock antiX-init versus starting haveged in antiX-init.
I measured the starting time of the whisker menu.

h_in_antiX-init    antiX=   Times (seconds)
    Y               MLX     35.48    35.48
    Y               MX      35.20    35.87
    N               MLX     34.89    36.21    35.10
    N               MX      36.47    34.94    36.81


explore checkbox items in gfxboot?

update isolinux.msg file ...
update antiX help

X Use one options menu with the entries (and not the titleX 
X programmable via options.men.  Just like desktop.men.

X Compare my gfxsave with RC2

X Investigate custom menu entry locally

?? use frugal in vbox for other problems and to verify.

Missing operating system.
FATAL: INT18 BOOT FAILURE

X Try chain loading via Grub on iso


X   1) time zone menu default worked but the time zone did not
X       get set.  BTW, you could use F12 to see if "tz=" is a boot
X       parameter.  Or "cat /proc/cmdline".

X This is broken in gfxboot.  Darn.

   2) "to ram" did not stick. The error message you got might be
      intermittent and not related to "to ram".

Works here.  Must look deeper.

   3) Custom main menu entry did not work.

Works here.  Must look deeper.
