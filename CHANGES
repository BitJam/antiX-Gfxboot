"init" --> "gfxtheme"  Other names?

Make MX and antiX bootloader from same source.  Differences
are in:

    1) background image(s)
    2) gfxboot (which Fn menus are used)
    3) contents of options menu
    4) Help file

Remove as many unused menus as possible to save space to let
chain.c32 work.  Can it get it to work with 1024 res?

Use text files to customize menus.  We had already been doing
this for the desktop menu.  Now do it for Options as well.

Given up on "guessing" the default desktop.  Instead just have a
"default" entry that does not add a desktop= cheat.  I did allow
for a "desktop.top" file which would set the label on the default
desktop entry (with no desktop=xxx cheat) but that is just too
complicated IMO.

Changed format of isolinux.cfg (syslinux.cfg).  Added

    MENU LABEL  ....

fields.  The LABELs are now short single words that are used to
identify an entry and possibly boot it as well (if all else
fails).  We also use the labels to turn off the options field on
some entries.  The MENU LABEL has spaces, not underscores.  We
only needed the underscores when we used the LABEL field as the
menu label.

I've easily gotten the size of the gfxtheme (was init) file down
to 95K but chain.c32 still does not work when I use a resolution
of 1024.

So for now, but the Options the and Desktop menu will be
modifiable by the user just be editing a text .men file.  I could
easily extend this to the Video Mode, Console, and Save menus,
etc.  Just not Language or Timezone (I think).


I have still not figure out how to have "splash=v" when F7
changes to "Save".  

KNOWN ISSUES:

  1) chain.c32 does not work at 1024x768

  2) nobootoptions in gfxboot.cfg still relies on the visible
     MENU LABELs, not the abbreviated LABELs.

  3) I may need to add back in menus used by MX such as
     the DPI menu.  I want to only add back what is needed.

  4) "make antiX-image" and "make MX-images" put their output
     images in the Input/$DISTRO/ directories which is highly
     counter-intuitive.
